## The project was inspired by the architectural disadvantages of the most popular messengers:

### Client - Server architecture:
<br />
    <div align="center">
        <a href="https://github.com/Mihalic2040/Rosa-Desktop">
            <img src="/images/client-server.png" alt="Logo">
        </a>
    </div>

### No source code:
<br />
    <div align="center">
        <a href="https://github.com/Rosa-Devs/Router">
            <img src="/images/code.png" alt="Logo">
        </a>
    </div>

## In my opinion, this program can solve these problems and provide people with the most reliable messaging service.

# What is this?
Router this is base of CLI. He provide a local http api to communicate with P2P network.
This will allow me to write a client to a dear person who knows how to interact with the JSON HTTP API.
