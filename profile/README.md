2. (Rosa-Desktop)[https://github.com/Rosa-Devs/Rosa-Desktop] - This is desktop cli of Rosa App.


## The project was inspired by the architectural disadvantages of the most popular messengers:

### Client - Server architecture:

            <img src="/images/client-server.png" alt="Logo">
        </a>
    </div>

### No source code:
<br />
    <div align="center">
        <a href="https://github.com/Rosa-Devs/Router">
            <img src="/images/code.png" alt="Logo">
        </a>
    </div>

In my opinion, this program can solve these problems and provide people with the most reliable messaging service.

# What we are doing?
We are creating a platform for decentralized messaging that will ensure the safety of its users and the speed of the network.
